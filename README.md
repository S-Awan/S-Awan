### Hi there 👋

I'm a CS and Physics student interested in applying quantitative modeling and data analysis to complex systems, from physics to financial markets.

* 🔭 I’m currently working on a **[Telemetry Dashboard](https://github.com/S-Awan/formula-dashboard)** for the Dartmouth Formula Racing team.
* 🌱 I’m currently learning more about **cloud deployment (AWS/Docker)** and **quantitative modeling techniques**.
* 💬 Ask me about **C, Python, physics simulations, or data analysis**.
* 📫 How to reach me: **[Email](mailto:shahzaib.awan.ug@dartmouth.edu)** or **[LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/shahzalb)**
* ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a big **squash** and **cricket** fan.
